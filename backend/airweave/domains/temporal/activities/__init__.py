"""Temporal activity classes.

Each activity is a class with:
- Dependencies declared in __init__
- A @activity.defn decorated method

Activities are instantiated and wired in worker/wiring.py using the DI container.

For workflow compatibility, we also export the activity method references.
These are used by workflows when calling execute_activity() with a function reference.
