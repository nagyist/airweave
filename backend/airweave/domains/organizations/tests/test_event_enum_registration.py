"""Tests for organization event enum registration.

Verifies that OrganizationEventType is properly registered in the
EventType union and ALL_EVENT_TYPE_ENUMS tuple. If these are missing,
events won't match subscriber patterns and the webhook EventType enum
(derived from ALL_EVENT_TYPE_ENUMS) won't include org events.
